# API Quickstart

This repository includes the source code for a C# .NET console application that demonstrates how to interact with the API using an HTTP client.

The best place to start is the Bearer Authentication Demo in the src/cli folder. This example shows how to generate a  JWT bearer token and then use it to send authenticated API requests. It shows how to process typical API responses for  groups, user accounts, and gradebooks. There are many more data sets available, of course. The source code here is intended as an example only, to help you get started.

> Please note this quickstart applies to version 2 of the API.
